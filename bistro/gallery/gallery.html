<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">[Back to Home]</a></p>
<p>Not only is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram snap before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<br>We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<br>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>
